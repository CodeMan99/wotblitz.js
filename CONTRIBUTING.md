How to Contribute
=================

Thanks for taking the time to think about improving [wotblitz]!

Reporting Problems
------------------

1. Capture the output of the problem(s). Both command line arguments and stdout/stderr.
2. Put it on a public [gist](//gist.github.com).
3. Look for an existing [issue](//github.com/CodeMan99/wotblitz.js/issues). Add to any related issue.
4. Repeats your steps that creates the problem(s).
5. Create a new issue if you haven't reported everything yet.
6. Include the version of `wotblitz`, `npm`, `node`, and maybe your shell too.
7. Make sure to link to the gist from step 2. Or if it's really short, a fenced code block is fine.

Code Changes
------------

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch that describes your work. We prefer you use a name that will describe your pull request.
 Long names are fine!
3. Write documentation. Especially true if you know what your change will be. If you are having trouble
 documenting your change, consider writing an [issue](//github.com/CodeMan99/wotblitz.js/issues) to discuss
 your change.
4. Write your change. Try to follow the same style as the code you are working on.
5. Test your change. Preferrably, write a *new* test over changing an *existing* test.
6. Create your pull request against the [default branch](//github.com/CodeMan99/wotblitz.js/commits).
7. Correct any errors reported by the [ci server](https://travis-ci.org/CodeMan99/wotblitz.js).
