========

[World of Tanks Blitz](http://wotblitz.com/) API wrapper.

Limitations
-----------

All data is pulled directly from Wargaming's API for World of Tanks. When in-game
items are missing (like a new tank line) it is due to the fact that Wargaming does
not update their API very often. Missing data is out of the control of this
application. Any ticket created on this topic will be closed with a "wont fix" label.
